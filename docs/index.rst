Welcome to python-valve's documentation!
========================================
python-valve is a Python library which aims to provide the ability to
interface with various Valve services and products, including: the Steam
web API, locally installed Steam clients, Source servers and the Source
master server.

Although Python libraries *do* already exist for many aspects which
python-valve aims to cover, many of them are ageing and no long maintained.
python-valve hopes to change that and provide an all-in-one library for
interfacing with Valve products and services that is well tested, well
documented and actively maintained.

python-valve's functional test suite for its A2S implementation is actively
ran against thousands of servers to ensure that if any subtle changes are made
by Valve that break things they can be quickly picked up and fixed.
