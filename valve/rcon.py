_USAGE = """
Usage:
  {program}
  {program} ADDRESS [-p PASSWORD]
  {program} ADDRESS -p PASSWORD -e COMMAND

Arguments:
  ADDRESS       Address of the server to connect to. If the port number
                is not given it will default to 27015.

Options:
  -h --help     Show this help.
  -p PASSWORD --password=PASSWORD
                Password to use when authenticating with the server.
  -e COMMAND --execute=COMMAND
                Command to execute on the server.

By default this will create a shell for connecting and issuing commands
to an RCON server. You can either specify the host and password as
command-line arguments or use the !connect command once the shell as started.

Alternately, if the --execute option is used then the given command will
be executed and the response printed to stdout.
